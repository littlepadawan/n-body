# The N-body problem
This program was developed by Ida Hellqvist and David Lide for the course Numerical Methods and Simulation at Uppsala University (1TD403, 5 credits). The task was to implement Python code that calculates the evolution of N particles in a gravitational simulation and calculate the motion of an initial set of particles that approximates the evolution of a galaxy.
